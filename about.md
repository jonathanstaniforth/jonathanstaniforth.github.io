Hi, I'm [Jon](https://github.com/jonathanstaniforth).
My background is in web-based systems development, where I develop, and deploy systems on the web, as well as getting involved with server configurations. My experience of developing these systems so far has mostly been in a startup environment, using the latest technologies such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which you can probably see from this blog. Recently, I have been involved in several projects, both as a manager, and developer, in Singapore, and China. One such project is [NeuRec](https://github.com/NExTplusplus/NeuRec), an open source Python package containing a large number of neural recommender models out of the box.
This blog can be seen as a collection of notes containing information that I had to piece together from different sources or could not find when developing. I have put these notes on the web for others to view as a way of giving back to the web community, albeit a small contribution, which I have taken from for a long time. When posting to this blog, I will try not to repeat information that is available else.
You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathanstaniforth) and
