I"¬<p>When transferring large amounts of data between devices on a network the amount of bandwidth available can soon become a limiting factor.
Normally, to increase bandwidth you need to upgrade the network hardware in the devices, however, the increments in bandwidth are large, e.g. 100 Mb/s to 1000 Mb/s, and can be costly.
But, network cards can come with several Ethernet ports, allowing connections to multiple devices.</p>
