I"<p>There is some speculation as to the origin of <strong>test-driven development</strong> with some saying it started in the <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Kent-Beck-refer-to-the-rediscovery-of-test-driven-development-Whats-the-history-of-test-driven-development-before-Kent-Becks-rediscovery">1940s or 50s</a>.
Also, it has been closely linked with <strong>test-first development</strong>, which is a concept of <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org"><strong>extreme programming</strong></a> that started in 1996 and formalised in 2000 with the release of the book Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change by Kent Beck.
However, its formal introduction can be considered in 2002 with Kent Beck releasing another book titled Test-Driven Development: By Example.</p>
