I"|<p>In a recent move of offices, we had to stop our GitLab docker container and
decided to take the opportunity to improve the storage of our git repositories.
Instead of storing our git repositories on a desktop computer that’s acting as a
server, we wanted to move them to a Network Access Storage (NAS).
This NAS is by <a href="https://www.synology.com/">Synology</a> and has been set up with RAID to automatically backup data stored on the device,
providing us with better resilience against storage failure.
Additionally, it provides some optimisations in data transfer and storage, which
the standard desktop doesn’t have.</p>
