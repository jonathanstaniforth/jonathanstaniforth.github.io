I"v<p>Telegram has an API that allows external systems, called a bot, to be used inside of the Telegram app through the sending and recieving of messages, called the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram Bot API</a>. Essentially, an external system holds the logic of the bot, and contains an API endpoint which Telegram calls when a user wants to interact with the bot. This interaction can occur as either direct messages in a private chat or with an <strong>@</strong> mention in groups. I have been experimenting with the Telegram Bot API to see what it can do, and this post provides a few notes on its use.</p>
