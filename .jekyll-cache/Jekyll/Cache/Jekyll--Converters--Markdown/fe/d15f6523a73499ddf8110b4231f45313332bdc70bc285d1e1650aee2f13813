I"ý<p>It has been a long time since I have done backend development, as recently I have been focusing on server configuration and frontend work. However, a new personal project that I have been working on has got me involved with backend dev again. This project started when forest fires in Indonesia created a haze that affected several countries in South East Asia. Many people were affected, including myself, and I started to read more into the issue, eventually coming across an idea for a new project.</p>
